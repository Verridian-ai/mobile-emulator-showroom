## What Was Built

### Core System
1. **Screenshot Capture Module** - Full device, viewport, and element-specific capture

3. **Error Monitor Module** - Automatic error detection with screenshot
4. **Integration Layer** - Seamless coordination between modules

### User Interface
1. **Navigation Controls** - 4 new buttons (screenshot, inspection, settings, history)
2. **Settings Modal** - Configure capture mode, format, quality, IDE preference
3. **History Gallery** - View, download, and send previous screenshots
4. **Error Overlay** - Visual error reporting with one-click IDE reporting

### Features
- Full device frame capture with html2canvas
- Viewport-only capture mode
- Interactive element inspection (hover + click)
- Automatic screenshot on JavaScript errors
- IndexedDB storage (max 20 screenshots)
- Multiple IDE support (Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor, filesystem)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+S, E, Q)

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start Server (if not running)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Danie\Desktop\mobile-emulator-worktrees\frontend-ui

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to http://localhost:4175

### 3. Test Screenshot Capture
1. Click camera icon button in navigation bar
2. Verify notification: "Screenshot captured successfully!"
3. Check browser console for success log

### 4. Test Element Inspection
1. Click layer icon button (should turn purple/active)
2. Hover over page elements (should highlight with purple border)
3. Click any element to capture it
4. Verify notification appears
5. Click layer icon again to exit inspection mode

### 5. Test Settings
1. Click gear icon button

5. Click screenshot to open full-size

### 7. Test Error Monitoring
1. Open browser DevTools console
2. Type: `throw new Error('Test error')`
3. Press Enter
4. Error overlay appears in bottom-right
5. Click "Report to IDE" button
6. Verify screenshot was auto-captured (check history)

### 8. Test Keyboard Shortcuts
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` → Takes screenshot

## Playwright MCP Validation Script

**Note:** Playwright is currently in use by another agent. When available, run:

```javascript
// 1. Navigate to page
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:4175' });

// 2. Take initial screenshot
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-initial.png'
});

// 3. Click screenshot button
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: 'Screenshot button',
  ref: '#screenshotBtn'
});

// 4. Wait for capture
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ time: 2 });

// 5. Screenshot notification
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-notification.png'
});

// 6. Test inspection mode
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: 'Inspection button',
  ref: '#inspectionBtn'
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-inspection-active.png'
});

// 7. Open settings modal
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: 'Settings button',
  ref: '#screenshotSettingsBtn'
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-settings-modal.png'
});

// 8. Close settings
await mcp__playwright__browser_press_key({ key: 'Escape' });

// 9. Open history modal
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: 'History button',
  ref: '#screenshotHistoryBtn'
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-history-modal.png'
});

// 10. Check console for errors
const consoleMessages = await mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages();
console.log('Console messages:', consoleMessages);

// 11. Test responsive
await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({ width: 375, height: 812 });
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-mobile-375.png'
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({ width: 768, height: 1024 });
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-tablet-768.png'
});

await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'phase-2.3-desktop-1920.png'
});

// 12. Accessibility snapshot
await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
```

## Expected Console Output

When page loads successfully, console should show:
```
IndexedDB initialized for screenshot history
IDE Detection Results: { detected: null, capabilities: {...}, status: 'fallback' }
Screenshot system initialized successfully
Browser navigation initialized
Screenshot integration complete. Use Ctrl+Shift+S to capture, Ctrl+Shift+E for inspection mode.
```

When capturing screenshot:
```
Screenshot saved to history
Screenshot captured successfully!
```

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Cross-Origin Iframes:**
   - Cannot capture content from different origins
   - Falls back to capturing blank/generic iframe
   - Not a bug, browser security restriction

2. **IDE Auto-Detection:**
   - Claude Code API not yet available in browser context
   - Falls back to filesystem API (download)
   - User can configure preferred IDE in settings

3. **Large Screenshots:**
   - iPad Pro frames may take 2-3 seconds to capture
   - High-quality settings generate large data URLs
   - Consider this normal, not a performance issue

4. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - html2canvas library loaded from CDN
   - File System Access API only in Chromium browsers
   - Fallback to download link works in all browsers
