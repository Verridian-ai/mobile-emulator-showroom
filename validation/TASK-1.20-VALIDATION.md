## Recommendations

### Maintain Performance

1. **Integrate into CI/CD:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Performance Check
     run: |
       npm run build
       npm run perf:bundle
       # Fails CI if bundle exceeds 500KB
   ```

2. **Regular Audits:**
   - Run `npm run perf:all` before each PR
   - Set up Lighthouse CI for automated checks
   - Monitor Web Vitals in production

3. **Performance Budgets:**
   - Vite config warnings at 500KB
   - CI failure at bundle size regression
   - Track metrics over time

### Future Enhancements

While all targets exceeded, consider:

1. Service Worker for offline support
2. HTTP/2 server push for critical assets
3. Resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)
4. Image lazy loading for off-screen content
5. Route-based code splitting if app grows

## Issues Found

**None.** All performance targets exceeded with exceptional results.
