# Specification: Device Frame Modularization

**Specification ID:** 002-device-frame-refactoring
**Created:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Active
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Methodology:** Spec-Kit
**Constitution:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

---

## Overview

Transform the Mobile Emulator Platform's device frame system from a monolithic CSS architecture to a modular, component-based system where each device is an independent, self-contained module with standardized interfaces.

---

## User Stories

### US-1: Developer Maintainability
**As a** platform developer
**I want** each device frame in its own file
**So that** I can update individual devices without affecting others

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each device has its own module file (e.g., `src/devices/apple/iphone-14-pro.js`)
- Device modules follow standardized interface
- Changes to one device don't require testing all devices
- Device-specific code is co-located (CSS, specs, features)

---

### US-2: Easy Device Addition
**As a** platform maintainer
**I want** a simple process to add new devices
**So that** I can keep the platform up-to-date with new hardware releases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New device requires only creating one module file
- Device auto-registers with the system
- Documentation template provided
- Visual validation automated (Playwright MCP)

---

### US-3: Performance Optimization
**As a** end user
**I want** fast device switching
**So that** I can efficiently test across multiple devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Device switching remains < 300ms
- Only active device CSS loaded (code splitting)
- Bundle size reduced by 30%
- 60fps animations maintained

---

### US-4: Visual Accuracy
**As a** designer/developer
**I want** pixel-perfect device frames
**So that** I can accurately preview my designs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All device dimensions match official specifications (Â±2px)
- Notches, Dynamic Island, punch-holes accurately rendered
- Physical buttons positioned correctly
- Materials and colors authentic

---

### US-5: Comprehensive Testing
**As a** QA engineer
**I want** automated visual regression testing
**So that** I can ensure device frames remain accurate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Playwright MCP captures screenshots of all devices
- Visual regression tests detect frame changes
- Each device has unit tests
- Performance benchmarks automated

- **TR-2.6**: CSS generation function

### TR-3: Build System Integration
- **TR-3.1**: Vite plugin for device CSS compilation
- **TR-3.2**: Hot module replacement for device changes
- **TR-3.3**: Code splitting per device
- **TR-3.4**: Minification and optimization

### TR-4: Testing Infrastructure
- **TR-4.1**: Unit tests for each device module
- **TR-4.2**: Visual regression tests (Playwright MCP)
- **TR-4.3**: Performance benchmarks (device switching < 300ms)
- **TR-4.4**: Cross-browser validation

### TR-5: Documentation
- **TR-5.1**: API documentation for device interface
- **TR-5.2**: Guide for adding new devices
- **TR-5.3**: Migration guide from old system
- **TR-5.4**: Troubleshooting guide
