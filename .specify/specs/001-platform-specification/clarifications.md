# Clarification Questions - Mobile Emulator Platform

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Specification:** 001-platform-specification
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Clarification

---

## Purpose
Before proceeding with `/tasks` and `/implement`, we need to clarify ambiguities in the specification to ensure we build the right solution.

---

## Critical Clarifications Needed

### 1. WebSocket Integration Scope
**Question:** What is the intended use of the WebSocket broker connection?

**Current State:**
- Code attempts to connect to `ws://localhost:7071`
- Multiple WebSocket-related files exist (broker, protocols, agents)
- Connection currently fails (no broker server running)

**Options:**
- **A)** WebSocket is required - we need to build/configure the broker server
- **B)** WebSocket is optional - make it a togglable feature
- **C)** WebSocket is deprecated - remove all related code

**Impact:** Affects architecture, dependencies, testing strategy

**Recommendation:** Option B (optional feature) unless you have active integrations using it

---

### 2. AI Chat Integration Status
**Question:** Which AI chat integration should remain active?

**Current State:**
- Multiple AI chat implementations:
  - `claude-chat-interface.js`
  - `claude-api-enhancement-agent.js`
  - `ai-chat-integration.js`
  - `claude-cli-bridge.js`
- Unclear which is the "official" version

**Options:**
- **A)** Keep one, archive others (which one?)
- **B)** They serve different purposes, document each
- **C)** Remove all, not needed for core emulator

**Impact:** Code cleanup, bundle size, maintenance

**Recommendation:** Option C unless actively using AI chat features

---

### 3. Collaboration Features
**Question:** Are the collaboration features (realtime, sessions) currently used or planned?

**Current State:**
- `collaboration-system.js` (50KB)
- `realtime-collaboration-agent.js` (66KB)
- No visible UI for collaboration
- No backend infrastructure

**Options:**
- **A)** Active feature - keep and document
- **B)** Future feature - keep but disable
- **C)** Not planned - archive

**Impact:** Architecture complexity, security requirements

**Recommendation:** Option C unless you have multi-user use cases

---

### 4. Asset Optimization Strategy
**Question:** What is the priority for visual quality vs. performance?

**Current State:**
- High-quality assets (18MB logo PNG)
- Beautiful cosmic video background (37MB)
- Rich visual effects (particles, glassmorphism)

**Options:**
- **A)** Performance first - aggressive optimization, remove video
- **B)** Balanced - optimize but keep key visuals
- **C)** Quality first - lazy load, but preserve fidelity

**Impact:** Load time, user experience, bandwidth

**Recommendation:** Option A for Phase 1, can enhance later

---

### 5. Device Frame Accuracy Requirements
**Question:** How accurate must device frames be?

**Current State:**
- CSS-based device mockups
- Approximate dimensions and styling
- No pixel-perfect validation

**Options:**
- **A)** Visual approximation is fine
- **B)** Must match actual device specs exactly
- **C)** Need real device screenshots for comparison

**Impact:** Testing requirements, design effort

**Recommendation:** Option A unless design validation is critical

---

### 6. Browser Support Priority
**Question:** What browsers and versions must be supported?

**Current State:**
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- No transpilation

**Options:**
- **A)** Evergreen browsers only (Chrome/Firefox/Safari latest)
- **B)** Last 2 versions of major browsers
- **C)** IE11 support needed (requires heavy transpilation)

**Impact:** Build complexity, bundle size, testing

**Recommendation:** Option A (evergreen browsers)

---

### 7. Deployment Environment
**Question:** Where will this be deployed?

**Current State:**
- Express server on port 4175
- Static file serving
- No containerization

**Options:**
- **A)** Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- **B)** Traditional server (VPS with Node.js)
- **C)** Container (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **D)** Local development only

**Impact:** Build output, server requirements, CI/CD

**Recommendation:** Need your input - affects build configuration

---

### 8. Testing Scope for Phase 1
**Question:** What test coverage is acceptable for Phase 1?

**Current State:**
- Zero tests currently

**Options:**
- **A)** Critical path only (~40% coverage)
- **B)** Comprehensive (80% coverage as planned)
- **C)** Defer to Phase 3 (ship faster)

**Impact:** Timeline, confidence, technical debt

**Recommendation:** Option A for Phase 1, expand in Phase 3

---

### 9. TypeScript Migration Timeline
**Question:** When should we migrate to TypeScript?

**Current State:**
- Pure JavaScript
- No type checking

**Options:**
- **A)** Phase 1 - JSDoc types only
- **B)** Phase 2 - Full TypeScript migration
- **C)** Phase 3/4 - After stabilization
- **D)** Never - stay with JavaScript

**Impact:** Development speed, safety, learning curve

**Recommendation:** Option A (JSDoc) → Option B (TypeScript in Phase 2)

---

### 10. Feature Flag System
**Question:** Should optional features be toggleable via config?

**Current State:**
- Features hardcoded
- No configuration system

**Options:**
- **A)** Environment variables only
- **B)** Config file (JSON/YAML)
- **C)** UI settings panel
- **D)** No configuration needed

**Impact:** Flexibility, complexity, UX

**Recommendation:** Option A (env vars) for Phase 1

---

## Clarifications for Immediate Action (Phase 1)

### Priority 1: Must Answer Before Starting
1. **WebSocket Integration** - Keep, make optional, or remove?
2. **Asset Strategy** - Aggressive optimization vs. preserve quality?
3. **Deployment Target** - Hosting environment?

### Priority 2: Can Decide During Implementation
4. AI Chat Integration status
5. Collaboration features necessity
6. Testing coverage target for Phase 1

### Priority 3: Future Considerations
7. Device frame accuracy requirements
8. TypeScript migration timeline
9. Feature flag system
10. Browser support matrix

## Proposed Answers (Awaiting Your Confirmation)

Based on the specification and common best practices, here are my recommended answers:

| Question | Recommended Answer | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| WebSocket | Make optional (B) | Avoid breaking existing code, enable future use |
| AI Chat | Remove for now (C) | Not core to device emulation |
| Collaboration | Archive (C) | No infrastructure, future feature |
| Assets | Aggressive optimization (A) | 93% load time improvement |
| Device Frames | Visual approximation (A) | Sufficient for testing |
| Browser Support | Evergreen only (A) | Modern stack, easier maintenance |
| Deployment | Need your input | Affects build config |
| Testing (Phase 1) | Critical path 40% (A) | Ship faster, expand later |
| TypeScript | JSDoc → TS Phase 2 (A→B) | Gradual, safe migration |
| Feature Flags | Env vars (A) | Simple, sufficient |

## Next Steps After Clarification

Once you've answered these questions (especially Priority 1), I will:

1. **Update specification** with clarified requirements
2. **Run `/tasks`** to break down Phase 1 into specific implementation tasks
3. **Run `/implement`** to execute tasks following TDD methodology
4. **Validate against constitution** at each milestone
