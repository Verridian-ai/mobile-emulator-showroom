## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Setup Git Worktrees** (if not done)
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Danie\Desktop\Mobile emulater"

   # Run setup script from GIT_WORKTREE_SETUP.md
   mkdir -p ../mobile-emulator-worktrees
   git worktree add ../mobile-emulator-worktrees/frontend-ui agent/frontend-ui
   git worktree add ../mobile-emulator-worktrees/backend-infrastructure agent/backend-infrastructure
   git worktree add ../mobile-emulator-worktrees/core-business-logic agent/core-business-logic
   git worktree add ../mobile-emulator-worktrees/build-tooling agent/build-tooling
   git worktree add ../mobile-emulator-worktrees/testing-qa agent/testing-qa
   ```

2. **Verify Playwright MCP** is accessible
   ```bash
   # Test Playwright MCP
   mcp__playwright__browser_navigate --url "https://example.com"
   ```

3. **Assign Next Round of Tasks**
   ```
   @frontend-ui-specialist â†’ Task 1.3 (Handle video)
   @core-business-logic â†’ Task 1.5 (URL validation)
   @core-business-logic â†’ Task 1.10 (Archive files)
   @backend-infrastructure â†’ Task 1.6 (CSP headers)
   @testing-qa-validator â†’ Task 1.16 (Unit tests)
   ```

4. **GitHub Agent** - Setup monitoring
   ```
   @github-integration-specialist
   Begin monitoring all agent branches
   Track PR status
   Report CI failures
   ```

# Check all agents exist
/agents list

# Verify git branches
git branch -a
