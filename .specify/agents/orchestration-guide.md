# Agent Orchestration Guide - Mobile Emulator Platform

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Project:** Mobile Emulator Platform
**Methodology:** Spec-Kit + Multi-Agent Parallel Execution
**Agent Count:** 5 specialized agents

---

## Quick Start: Launch All 5 Agents

### Step 1: Create Agents (5 minutes)

Open Claude Code and create each agent:

```bash
# Agent 1: Frontend UI Specialist
/agents
# Paste prompt from your prepared agent-prompts.md - Agent 1

# Agent 2: Backend & Infrastructure Specialist
/agents
# Paste prompt from your prepared agent-prompts.md - Agent 2

# Agent 3: Core Business Logic Specialist
/agents
# Paste prompt from your prepared agent-prompts.md - Agent 3

# Agent 4: Build & Tooling Specialist
/agents
# Paste prompt from your prepared agent-prompts.md - Agent 4

# Agent 5: Testing & Quality Assurance Specialist
/agents
# Paste prompt from your prepared agent-prompts.md - Agent 5
```

### Step 2: Verify Agent Initialization

Each agent should confirm:
- âœ… Domain ownership understood
- âœ… Constitution articles acknowledged
- âœ… Quality gates confirmed
- âœ… Ready for task assignment

### Step 3: Launch Day 1 Tasks (Parallel Execution)

Send these commands **simultaneously** to all 5 agents:

```bash
@Frontend-UI-Specialist
Execute Task 1.2: Optimize Large PNG Images
Full details in: .specify/specs/001-platform-specification/tasks-phase1.md

Use Sharp.js or Squoosh. WebP with PNG fallback.
Report when complete and hand off to @Testing-QA-Specialist

@Backend-Infrastructure-Specialist
Execute Task 1.4: Install Security Dependencies
Full details in: .specify/specs/001-platform-specification/tasks-phase1.md

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup Format

Each agent reports:
1. **Completed yesterday:** [List tasks]
2. **Today's plan:** [Current task]
3. **Blockers:** [Dependencies waiting on other agents]
4. **Handoffs needed:** [Work ready for validation]

### Handoff Protocol

When an agent completes a task:

```markdown
## Task Handoff: [TASK_ID]

**From:** @[SOURCE_AGENT]
**To:** @[TARGET_AGENT] (usually Testing Agent)
**Task:** [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

**Completion Status:**
âœ… All acceptance criteria met
âœ… Constitution principles followed
âœ… Code documented
âœ… Self-tested

**Outputs:**
- Files created: [LIST]
- Files modified: [LIST]
- Tests written: [LIST]

**Validation Required:**
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Check code coverage
- [ ] Verify constitution compliance
- [ ] Review code quality

**Next Actions:**
@[TARGET_AGENT] please validate and approve.
```

### Blocker Resolution Protocol

When an agent is blocked:

```markdown
## BLOCKER: [TASK_ID]

**Blocked Agent:** @[AGENT_NAME]
**Blocking Agent:** @[AGENT_NAME]
**Reason:** [DESCRIPTION]

**Required to Unblock:**
- [ ] Task [X] must complete
- [ ] API contract must be defined
- [ ] Configuration decision needed

**Estimated Impact:** [TIME]
**Workaround Available:** [YES/NO] [DESCRIPTION]

**Requesting:** @[BLOCKING_AGENT] priority escalation
```

---

## Validation Checkpoints

### After Each Task (Testing Agent)

```markdown
## Validation Report: [TASK_ID]

**Agent:** @[IMPLEMENTATION_AGENT]
**Task:** [TASK_DESCRIPTION]
**Validator:** @Testing-QA-Specialist

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1: [STATUS]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [STATUS]
...

**Constitution Compliance:**
- [ ] Article [X]: [COMPLIANT/NON-COMPLIANT] [NOTES]

**Code Quality:**
- Test Coverage: [X]%
- Linting: [PASS/FAIL]
- Documentation: [COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE]

**Result:** [APPROVED / REJECTED / CONDITIONAL APPROVAL]

**Notes:**
[Any issues or recommendations]

**Signature:** @Testing-QA-Specialist [DATE]
```

### End of Day (All Agents)

```markdown
## Daily Summary: Day [X]

**Completed Tasks:**
- Task 1.X by @[AGENT] - VALIDATED âœ…
- Task 1.Y by @[AGENT] - VALIDATED âœ…

**In Progress:**
- Task 1.Z by @[AGENT] - 60% complete

**Blockers:**
- [DESCRIPTION] - Resolution: [PLAN]

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- @Frontend: [TASK]
- @Backend: [TASK]
- @Core: [TASK]
- @Build: [TASK]
- @Testing: [TASK]

**Risks:**
[Any risks identified]

**Overall Status:** [ON TRACK / AT RISK / BLOCKED]
```

---

## Emergency Protocols

### If an agent gets stuck (> 2 hours):

1. **Agent reports blocker** using Blocker Protocol
2. **Testing Agent investigates** root cause
3. **Orchestrator (you) decides:**
   - Reassign task to different agent?
   - Simplify task scope?
   - Escalate to human decision?
4. **Document decision** in clarifications

### If agents produce conflicting code:

1. **Testing Agent detects** conflict via test failures
2. **Relevant agents coordinate** to resolve
3. **Follow constitution** as tie-breaker
4. **Testing Agent validates** resolution

### If quality gates fail:

1. **Testing Agent rejects** task completion
2. **Implementation agent fixes** issues
3. **Resubmit for validation**
4. **No moving forward** until gates pass

@[AGENT-NAME] status report
```

### Assign New Task
```bash
@[AGENT-NAME] Execute Task [X.Y]: [TASK_NAME]
Review: .specify/specs/001-platform-specification/tasks-phase1.md
Report when complete and hand off to @Testing-QA-Specialist
```

### Request Validation
```bash
@Testing-QA-Specialist
Please validate Task [X.Y] completed by @[AGENT-NAME]
Use validation checklist from orchestration-guide.md
Report approval status
```

### Coordinate Between Agents
```bash
@[AGENT-1] and @[AGENT-2]
Coordinate on [ISSUE]
@[AGENT-1] provides [X]
@[AGENT-2] implements [Y]
Both report when synchronized
```

## Tips for Successful Orchestration

1. **Start each day** with task assignments to all agents
2. **Check in mid-day** for blocker resolution
3. **End each day** with validation sweep by Testing Agent
4. **Celebrate wins** - acknowledge completed tasks
5. **Trust the process** - agents follow spec-kit methodology
6. **Enforce quality gates** - Testing Agent is the gatekeeper
7. **Document everything** - maintain audit trail
8. **Stay parallel** - maximize concurrent work
